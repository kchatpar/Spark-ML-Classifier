Accusations that he would be an economic liability proved damaging to his previous tries.After once suggesting he could unpick the centerpiece of the current government's economic agenda - the opening of the oil and gas industry to private capital - Lopez Obrador has gradually shifted toward more moderate economic positions."Pejenomics" sought to dispel concerns that a Lopez Obrador victory could destabilize the economy, scotching the notion he would nationalize businesses or burden them with regulation. Instead, Mexico needed more competition, it said.The medley of proposals sketched out in the 17-page manifesto included fostering entrepreneurship, renewable energy technologies, domestic industry and small businesses, plus stirring up competition in banking and making the country self-sufficient in food.But it offered few details on how it would achieve them.
